This repo is for [apue 3ed](http://apuebook.com/apue3e.html)

In the book, at least chaper 1, does not compile. It mentioned the file apue.h and error.c which is present at the end of the book. I have downloaded the [source code](http://apuebook.com/code3e.html). The two files are in the tar ball.

To make the example of the book work, just 
- copy both apue.h and error.c into the same directory of the examples
- include error.c Yes, include a c file, not a h file.
